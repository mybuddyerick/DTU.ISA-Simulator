0: 5;    # (start number)
1: 0;    # for step counter
2: 0;    # Store longest sequence found
3: 0;    # Store number with longest sequence
4: 1;    # Const 1 (used for comparison)
5: 2;    # Const 2 (used for even check and division)
6: 3;    # Const 3 (used for odd-case multiplication)
7: 100;  # Upper bound for iteration
8: 0;    # Temporary storage (for checking repeated values if needed)
9: 0;    # Additional storage space (if cycle detection is added)
